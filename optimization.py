# Optimize the cost_function using the test set provided by data_handling
# computes useful statistic about algo performances

#   - Gradient Descent
#   - BFGS with Scipy.optimization
#   - Conjugate gradient ??  : never used might be interesting
#   - Stochastic Gradient Descent  (with Batch size) <= Might be good to reduce footprint

# Overfitting safeguard
#   - Regularization
#   - Early Stopping

# DEBUG mode
#   - save each iteration cost and plot them
#

# Question
#   is line search useful ?
